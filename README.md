# Business Analytics Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing transaction logs to extract business metrics and improve customer insights for an e-commerce platform. The analysis involved building conversion funnels, conducting cohort analysis, and calculating retention rates.

## Objectives
- Build a conversion funnel to track user journey and identify drop-off points.
- Conduct cohort analysis to understand user retention over time.
- Provide actionable recommendations to improve user engagement and conversion.

## Tools and Techniques
- **Excel**: Used for organizing and analyzing transaction logs.
- **Cohort Analysis**: To understand user behavior and retention.
- **Retention Metrics**: Calculated to identify areas of improvement.

## Key Insights
- **Conversion funnel**: The overall conversion rate from user visits to successful transactions was 12%, with significant drop-offs between adding items to the cart and completing purchases.
- **Retention rates**: Weekly retention showed that 40% of new users returned after the first week, but this number declined to 15% by week 4.
- **Customer behavior**: Frequent buyers were more likely to purchase high-value items and showed a higher retention rate of 25% after week 4.
